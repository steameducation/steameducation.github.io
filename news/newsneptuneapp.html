		<p style= "text-align: left;"><h2><b>The NepTune App Explained</b></h2>	
	     
<p style= "text-align: left;">One of the central aspects of the SPACE project is the development of an app that could serve both as a musical instrument and a learning tool for teachers and students of all levels. This app, now available as an open-source web-based app, is called NepTune, and was created by the members of all partner institutions together, through the first drafts and sketches to the final testing phase. The programming was implemented by the team from our external partners, Casa da Música. It is, by default, a STEAM project, involving all of its aspects.</p>

<p style= "text-align: left;">NepTune's main goal is to explore the common ground between science (specifically, astronomy) and music, using the planets from our solar system as a model. You can use it on any device capable of running an updated version of most web browsers, and it functions in three modes (found at the bottom): with pitched sounds from a scale you choose, with soundscapes based on the planets, and as a sampler for your own sounds. For each of these modes you just need to tap the planets it will play the assigned sounds. If you hold your finger on a planet it will show a fun fact about it, related to the STEAM subjects.</p>
