	<h2 style= "text-align:left;">Write A Science Opera Guidebook<h2>
		<p>Write a Science Opera (WASO) is a transdisciplinary, inquiry-based approach to teaching at the intersection of art and science in schools. In this guidebook, teachers will find the reasons and advantages to introducing young pupils to WASO. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to implement WASO in classrooms, with both pupils who can and cannot yet read and write. It is challenging, but the rewards are endless, robust and powerful. No two WASO projects are ever the same! In WASO, teachers hand over control to their pupils. Now it is those pupils’ curiosity and creative imagination which (in dialogue with their teacher) will develop their science and art curriculum.
		Get ready for an exciting journey…</p>
