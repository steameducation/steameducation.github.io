			<h2 style= "text-align: center;">As part of our project, we worked with students from Ireland, Norway and Belgium to develop STEAM resources for teachers and workshop leaders. We hope you enjoy the resources we have developed.</h2>
			<p style="text-align: left;">We have created a STEAM Recipe Online Repositary where we will also be featuring STEAM Recipes, and where you can also upload your own recipes to share. You can explore it right here: <a href="/spacerecipesdemo"></a>. </p>
			<p style="text-align: left;">To give you a taste of what the Online Repositary might contain, we've added some of the Recipes developed through the project below.</p>

	<h2 style= "text-align:left;">Write A Science Opera Guidebook</h2>
		<p>Write a Science Opera (WASO) is a transdisciplinary, inquiry-based approach to teaching at the intersection of art and science in schools. In this guidebook, teachers will find the reasons and advantages to introducing young pupils to WASO. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to implement WASO in classrooms, with both pupils who can and cannot yet read and write. It is challenging, but the rewards are endless, robust and powerful. No two WASO projects are ever the same! In WASO, teachers hand over control to their pupils. Now it is those pupils’ curiosity and creative imagination which (in dialogue with their teacher) will develop their science and art curriculum.
