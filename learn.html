        	<p>STEAM was developed in 2006 by Georgette Yakman, who then was a master&rsquo;s graduated student at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University&rsquo;s Integrated Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics Educational program (ISTEMed). Since then she has continued to evolve the concept by including more research and practice on the topic. She has used STEAM with significant results as a full-time middle-school and high-school teacher and educational consultant.</p>
		<p>Visit <a href="https://steamedu.com/about-us/">Georgette Yakman's website</a> to find out more about how she created STEAM.</p>
		<p>STEAM is a way to take the benefits of STEM and complete the package by integrating these principles in and through the arts. &nbsp;STEAM takes STEM to the next level: it allows students to connect their learning in these critical areas together with arts practices, elements, design principles, and standards to provide the whole pallet of learning at their disposal. &nbsp;STEAM removes limitations and replaces them with wonder, critique, inquiry, and innovation.</p>
