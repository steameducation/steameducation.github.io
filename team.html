<h2>Andr&eacute; Ramos - Flute Teacher</h2>
<p>Born in 1980, he began his studies at Vilar do Para&iacute;so Music Academy, where he completed complementary Flute and Piano courses, as well as the basic saxophone course. He continued his studies at the Higher Institute of Music and the Performing Arts, in Professor Raquel Lima's flute class. He obtained his Bachelor's Degree with a high score. His academic performance won him an Exceptional Merit Scholarship from IPP in 2006 and another Merit Scholarship from that institution in 2007.</p>
<p>It was in London, at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, that he became a Master of Music under Ian Clarke and Philippa Davies. He has worked with the London Symphony Orchestra and Philharmonic Orchestra, with maestros such as Sir John Eliot Gardiner, Paul Daniel, Leif Segerstam, and others. He has also been a guest musician in the London Arts Orchestra.</p>
<p>He recorded &ldquo;Stimmen&rdquo; by H. Henze, live for the BBC with the New Music Ensemble, at a concert that was attended by the composer himself, which earned quite positive reviews. He was also first flute in the Guildhall Symphony Orchestra and, in 2010, he made his solo d&eacute;but at Wigmore Hall, at a concert on the theme of &ldquo;Voiceworks&rdquo;. And he was also first flute in the Galicia Youth Orchestra, participating in the 42nd Mozart festival. He won the &ldquo;Needlemakers&rsquo; prize&rdquo; (London) and received an Honourable Mention at the Helena S&aacute; e Costa Competition. He is now a guest of the Hong Kong Sinfonietta.</p>
<p>His interest is not limited to classical music; he was also assistant to the maestro in the musical &ldquo;Fame&rdquo;, and worked on the Portuguese version of &ldquo;Jesus Christ Superstar&rdquo; by Filipe La F&eacute;ria. He has also participated in the musicals &ldquo;Scents of Light&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rent&rdquo;, &ldquo;Grease&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lion King&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He has done dubbing work on several series for Disney and is the voice of one of the main characters in &ldquo;Jungle Book&rdquo; - Baloo (the bear). He has also worked on several RTP1 and NTV broadcasts.</p>
<p>Recently, as part of the &ldquo;Culture in Expansion&rdquo; project by the Porto Municipal Council, he arranged and orchestrated themes from the album &ldquo;Heat&rdquo; by Glockenwise, and he directed the Bonj&oacute;ia Youth Orchestra in the concert where they played with Glockenwise for the presentation of this meeting of different musical sensibilities and languages.</p>
<p>As a composer, his writing comes mainly from a process of improvisation/performance, combining a variety of influences, such as jazz, rock and pop, music from the early 20th century and electronic music. His instrumental eclecticism can also be seen in his musical compositions, ranging from his live d&eacute;but performance of works for chamber groups with electronic music (<em>Mars One</em>, Vila do Conde New Music Encounters, February 2016) to symphony works for Children's and Adult's choirs (<em>A Children&rsquo;s Requiem Brevis</em>, Lapa Church, March 2015).
