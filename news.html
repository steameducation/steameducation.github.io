	<p style= "text-align: left;"><h2><b>SPACE students bring science to life in class through STEAM-workshop</b></h2>
	<p style= "text-align: left;">23/11/2017</p>
			
	<p style= "text-align: left;"><b>Six senior SPACE students of AP university College gave a STEAM-workshop about Climate Change for both national and international students during the international STEAM Week – hosted by AP University College from the 20th till 24th of November 2017 – at Campus Spoor Noord in Antwerp. During the workshop, students had to create a water and air purifier with only basic materials to get a sense of climate impact connected to air and water pollution. Laura Palinckx, last year student Secondary Education, is one of the SPACE students that held the workshop and elaborates her experiences of both the workshop and the SPACE project.</b>

	<p style= "text-align: left;">“The workshop was absolutely fun and informative. I think all participating students loved it. We even introduced ourselves with a bit of slam poetry. Which makes sense, since art-performance is a key element in STEAM-education. After that we made two groups of students and gave them some cloth,</p> 
	<p style= "text-align: left;">bottles and other basic material to assemble a water and/or air purifier” explains Laura. “It didn’t have to get too advanced or technical, it was meant to improve their interest in science, their knowledge about how these things work and of course, how it is connected to climate change.”</p>   
	
	<p style= "text-align: left;"><b>To Vlissingen and back</b>
	
	<p style= "text-align: left;">The workshop needed careful preparation because, ultimately, the subject material is meant to educate children of pre-primary and primary schools about science and climate change. “That’s why we went to HZ University of Applied Sciences in Vlissingen, The Netherlands, last week in the context of their own international week. We presented the concept of STEAM-education and practiced our workshop over there with interested students. It was an ideal preparation for the real workshop during the STEAM-week” says Laura in retrospect.</p>
	
	<p style= "text-align: left;">Pascale Mast, lecturer at AP University College and co-organizer of the STEAM-week continues: “The trip to Vlissingen meant an international exchange of knowledge and experiences in relation to the STEAM-week with foreign students within the SPACE-atmosphere, but it was also a great way to strengthen the bonds with our Dutch education partner HZ University College in Vlissingen. We intensely invest into internationalization of students and this opportunity perfectly matched our interests and needs.”</p> 
			
	<p style= "text-align: left;"><b>SPACE as an advantage</b>
	
	<p style= "text-align: left;">The SPACE project sure has a positive effect on student’s curriculum, as Laura explains enthusiastically: “The SPACE project really means a lot to my teacher training study program. Since I entered the program last year I had the chance to implement science courses in a very creative and playful way.</p> 		
	<p style= "text-align: left;">This mainly happened within the context of STEAM-education where we look at artistic ways to teach children and youngsters about science, technology, engineering and/or mathematics. I really love it, especially because starting from September 2018 I’m going to teach math to secondary school students. SPACE helped me to find alternative and pleasant ways to make math a more interesting course.”</p> 	
		
			
			
			
		
        <p style= "text-align: left;"><h2><b>SPACE is heating up for the next international STEAM-week</b></h2>
	<p style= "text-align: left;">13/11/2017</p>
		
	<p style= "text-align: left;"><b>ANTWERP - The next International STEAM-week (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) of AP University College will take place from the 20th till the 24th of November and will host 150 belgian and international students.</b> 
	<p style= "text-align: left;"><b>The STEAM-week is an integral part of the SPACE-project (Strategic Partnership: Agents of Change in Education) that aims to educate pre-primary and primary school children through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DiyyjhLvjw">the WASO education model</a>.</b> 
	<p style= "text-align: left;"><b>By integrating art into STEAM-lessons, children not only develop artistic skills in a very pleasant and playful way but also book better learning results. The theme of this year’s STEAM-week will be ‘climate change’.</b> 
	<p style= "text-align: left;">The third Edition of AP’s ‘International STEM-week’ builds on last year’s successful editions wherein Belgian teacher training students (pre-primary and primary education), international teacher training students studying at AP University College in context of Erasmus+ and international teacher training students coming from different partner institutions will take part.</p> 
	<p style= "text-align: left;">They will be introduced to the exhilarating world of STEAM education through thematic workshops by both Belgian and international teachers. During the workshops all students will focus on the question of how teachers can integrate STEAM when educating pre-primary and primary pupils on climate change.</p>		
	<p style= "text-align: left;">On Friday the 24th of November all students have to implement and execute their own STEAM workshops in pre—primary and primary schools based in Antwerp and Lier.</p> 	
	<p style= "text-align: left;">This third edition of AP’s ‘International STEAM Week’ follows last year’s very successful editions in which educational partners from Norway (Western Norway University of Applied Sciences), Ireland (Dundalk Institute of Technology), The Netherlands (Stenden University of Applied Sciences, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences, HZ University of Applied Sciences, Iselinge University of Applied Sciences), Portugal (Curso de Música Silva Monteiro), Slovenia (University of Maribor), Spain (Mondragon University) and Turkey (Hacettepe University) were involved.</p>		
					
			
			
			
			
			<p style= "text-align: left;"><h2><b>International STEAM-week launched in Lier and Antwerp</b></h2>
			<p style= "text-align: left;">ANTWERP - November 2016</p>	
        <p style= "text-align: center;">Dozens of teachers and students coming from 10 different European countries gave the kick-off of SPACE (Strategic Partnership: Agents of Change Education). An international organization managed by students that – in the context of Erasmus+ and AP University College as coordinator – will have an ambassador’s role the coming years in terms of education innovation.</p>
        <p style= "text-align: center;">The city Lier formed the basecamp of the first international project week wherein STEAM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) played the key-role. This meant great fun for all 194 preschoolers and children of primary school Stadspark who were submerged in the theme of this project week: human life on the moon.</p>
