        <p style= "text-align: left;"><b>The next International STEAM-week (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) of AP University College will take place from the 20th till the 24th of November and will host 150 belgian and international students.</b> 
	<p style= "text-align: left;"><b>The STEAM-week is an integral part of the SPACE-project (Strategic Partnership: Agents of Change in Education) that aims to educate pre-primary and primary school children through the WASO education model (link).</b> 
	<p style= "text-align: left;"><b>By integrating art into STEAM-lessons, children not only develop artistic skills in a very pleasant and playful way but also book better learning results. The theme of this year’s STEAM-week will be ‘climate change’.</b> 
	<p style= "text-align: left;">The third Edition of AP’s ‘International STEM-week’ builds on last year’s successful editions wherein Belgian teacher training students (pre-primary and primary education), international teacher training students studying at AP University College in context of Erasmus+ and international teacher</p> 
	<p style= "text-align: left;">training students coming from different partner institutions will take part.</p> 
	<p style= "text-align: left;">They will be introduced to the exhilarating world of STEAM education through thematic workshops by both Belgian and international teachers. During the workshops all students will focus on the question of how teachers can integrate STEAM when educating pre-primary and primary pupils on climate change.</p>		
	<p style= "text-align: left;">On Friday the 24th of November all students have to implement and execute their own STEAM workshops in pre—primary and primary schools based in Antwerp and Lier.</p> 	
	<p style= "text-align: left;">This third edition of AP’s ‘International STEAM Week’ follows last year’s very successful editions in which educational partners from Norway (Western Norway University of Applied Sciences), Ireland (Dundalk Institute of Technology), The Netherlands (Stenden University of Applied Sciences, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences, HZ University of Applied Sciences, Iselinge University of Applied Sciences), Portugal (Curso de Música Silva Monteiro), Slovenia (University of Maribor), Spain (Mondragon University) and Turkey (Hacettepe University) were involved.</p>		
			
			<p style= "text-align: left;"><b>International STEAM-week launched in Lier and Antwerp</b>
			<p style= "text-align: left;">ANTWEP - November 2016</p>	
        <p style= "text-align: center;">Dozens of teachers and students coming from 10 different European countries gave the kick-off of SPACE (Strategic Partnership: Agents of Change Education). An international organization managed by students that – in the context of Erasmus+ and AP University College as coordinator – will have an ambassador’s role the coming years in terms of education innovation.</p>
        <p style= "text-align: center;">The city Lier formed the basecamp of the first international project week wherein STEAM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) played the key-role. This meant great fun for all 194 preschoolers and children of primary school Stadspark who were submerged in the theme of this project week: human life on the moon.</p>
