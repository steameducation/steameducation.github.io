        		<h1 style="text-align: center;">Steam Education - Play</h1>
        <p style= "text-align: center;"> At the Space project we love to play. As part of the project we are developing an app to help teachers and pupils explore science through music. We'll be launching our app in 2019.</p>
        <p style= "text-align: center;">If you would like to play now, you can click anywhere on our Space pages to make some music of your own.</p>
	<p>In our last Intensive Programme in Norway in February 2018, we explored lots of different apps to help us find inspiration to create our SPACE app. Here are some of the apps we liked best.&nbsp;</p>
	<p><a href="https://01som.casadamusica.com/">0+1=Som</a></p>
	<p>0 + 1 = SOM consisted of a series of workshops conducted in school context, in the primary school of the municipality of Braga (in nothern Portugal), with the aim of exposing students of age 6 to 10 to new techonologies applied to art. The workshops resulted in different kinds of games and software about original musical creation made by the students.</p>
	<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/circular-bells/id1062362784?mt=8">Circular Bells</a></p>
	<p>Circular Bells is a music app that lets you sit back and relax while you play with its brightly-coloured, ever-changing interface, and uplifting sounds. Move the bells around, create your own layouts, and then hit the button that makes everything float around. Chase the bells, and play your favourite tunes! It's made for Ipad and Iphone.</p>
	<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gamult/id1199536126?mt=8">Gamult</a></p>
	<p>Gamult is a music app developed at Digit&oacute;pia Casa da M&uacute;sica. It was originally developed as an interface for the Robotic Gamelan, which allows the interaction between a digital controller and the Java Gamelan of Casa da M&uacute;sica. You can use it to create rhythms using a range of sounds. It's available for Ipad and Andriod.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.yatatoy.com/loopimal">Loopimal</a></p>
	<p>LOOPIMAL is a building kit of handcrafted animations and sounds. The possibilities of creations and compositions are endless. This app is great for young children - with an intuitive fun gesture they can create sequences for different animals.&nbsp; The content explores melody, rhythm and movement.&nbsp;There is no goal, no wrong or right, it&rsquo;s a safe kit for music creation. It's available for Ipad and Iphone.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.borderlands-granular.com/app/">Borderlands Granular</a></p>
	<p>Borderlands Granular uses a technique called granular synthesis, which involves the superposition of tiny fragments of sound, or &ldquo;grains," to create complex, evolving timbres and textures. The app is designed to be easy to use, emphasizing gestural interaction over knobs and sliders. Create, drag, and throw pulsing clouds of grains over a landscape of audio files, or use the built-in accelerometer to sculpt sound with gravity. Simply double tap to begin!</p>
