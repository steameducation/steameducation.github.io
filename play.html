The workshops resulted in different kinds of games and software about original musical creation made by the students.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.borderlands-granular.com/app/">Borderlands Granular</a></p>
	<p>Borderlands Granular uses a technique called granular synthesis, which involves the superposition of tiny fragments of sound, or &ldquo;grains," to create complex, evolving timbres and textures. The app is designed to be easy to use, emphasizing gestural interaction over knobs and sliders.
