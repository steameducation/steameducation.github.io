				<p style= "text-align: center;"> The SPACE project brought innovative existing approaches designed to provide Europe&#39;s future educators with the tools they need in order to exemplify how tomorrow&#39;s innovators act, interact, think, network, and teach. The project grew from past European projects and collaborations involving the project partner organisations.</p>
				<p style= "text-align: center;">The SPACE project exists at the meeting point of science, technology, art, entrepreneurship and innovation. Based on different approaches to STEAM Education, including the &quot;Write a Science Opera (WASO)&quot; approach, the SPACE project extended the limits of current models, encompassing additional fields of learning and knowledge.</p>
				<p style= "text-align: center;"">The project’s main objective was to establish an international student-run entrepreneurial organization. The result was a network of student teachers trained in the delivery of innovative cross-disciplinary art and science educational models to primary students. The project connected to a number of organisations and initiatives including the European Space Agency’s Technology Center (ESTEC), the Global Science Opera and AP Hogeschule's International STEAM week.</p>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">About STEAM Education</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">STEAM was developed in 2006 by Georgette Yakman, who then was a master&rsquo;s graduated student at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University&rsquo;s Integrated Science-Technology-Engineering-Mathematics Educational program (ISTEMed). Since then she has continued to evolve the concept by including more research and practice on the topic. She has used STEAM with significant results as a full-time middle-school and high-school teacher and educational consultant.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Visit <a href="https://steamedu.com/about-us/">Georgette Yakman's website</a> to find out more about how she created STEAM.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">STEAM is a way to take the benefits of STEM and complete the package by integrating these principles in and through the arts. &nbsp;STEAM takes STEM to the next level: it allows students to connect their learning in these critical areas together with arts practices, elements, design principles, and standards to provide the whole pallet of learning at their disposal. &nbsp;STEAM removes limitations and replaces them with wonder, critique, inquiry, and innovation.</p>
