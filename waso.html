				<p style= "text-align: center;"> The specific methodological approach which the project team is proposing is Write a Science Opera (WASO), a cross-disciplinary approach to science and art teaching in which an inquiry-based science teaching structure is extended to include the arts in each step of the pupils’ inquiry process.</p>
				<p style= "text-align: center;">Write a Science Opera (WASO) is a creative professional development approach to inquiry-based music and science education in which pupils of different ages, supported by teachers, opera artists and scientists, are the creators of an educational performance. WASO is an application of the widespread Write an Opera method, which has been successfully implemented in many countries during the past three decades. WASO integrates science education into the original method by involving scientists who lead an inquiry-based creative process demonstrating common impulses shared by science and the arts. The WASO concept was developed by Associate Professor Oded Ben-Horin and Professor Magne Espeland at Stord/Haugesund University College (Norway), based on meetings with RESEO, as well as the Royal Opera House (London)’s Education department.</p>
